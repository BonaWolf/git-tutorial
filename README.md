============

##Welcome to the Bonaventure git tutorial.

By completing these steps you will be ready to contribute to various department projects.

github has provided graphical tools to interact with hosted repositories. While "die-hard" console users would 
frown upon using a gui, the tool provides the functionality we need.

###Directions (see images below)

1. Create a github account and get added to the BonaventureCS Organization.
2. Download the github application corresponding to your operating system.<br>[Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) | [Github for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
3. Once installed, login to the github application with your account.
4. You should be able to see this repository (and others). Click clone this repository and select a location on disk to store it on your computer.
5. Create a fork off the master branch. A fork is a copy of any existing codebase that you can edit independently of said codebase. After you make your changes you can issue a pull request to have your new and improved code pulled into the master branch.
6. Navigate to the folder where you cloned this repository. Open up the file Rollcall.md (The md extension denotes a markdown file. It can be edited in any plain text editor i.e. Sublime Text, vim, notepad++ etc).
7. Add your name to the list and save the file.
8. Back in your github application prepare your commit. A commit is like a snapshot of your code that keeps track of all your changes. If something goes wrong you can always revert back to one of these commits.
9. Add a title and description to your changelog. 
10. Commit then sync.
11. Prepare your pull request. 
12. Wait as the previous step will send an email out to the admins of BonaventureCS on github. They can then review your changes and pull them into the main branch.

#####Congrats! You completed the git tutorial.
