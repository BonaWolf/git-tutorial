github has provided graphical tools to interact with hosted repositories. While "die-hard" console users would 
frown upon using a gui, the tool provides the functionality we need.

###Directions

2. Download the github application corresponding to your operating system. [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) | [Github for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
3. Once installed, login to the github application with your account.
